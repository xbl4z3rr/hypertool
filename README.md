Welcome to **Hyper Bot Tool** - the best Minecraft bot attack tool.

Installation is pretty straight forward you just select if you want to install it for all users or just the current one then let it install.

**Uasge:** <br>

* Open the app.
* Fill in the server ip (and port if it's not 25565)
* Fill in the bot amount value. (Optional)
* Start the attack by clicking on the button.
* You're done, but remember that some of the bots may not connect because of connection throttling.

> *Note: This application was made for educational purposes and I'm not responsible for any damage done with this app. I also ask you not to use this for attacking servers. I created this tool to help owners test their Anti-Bot plugins. Thank you for your understanding!*
